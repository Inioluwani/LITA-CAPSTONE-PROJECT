# LITA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
This where I document my capstone project for my LITA Data Analysis class with the incubator hub. Here, I analysed the sales data provided.

### Project Title: Sales Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project was done on a sales data where a number of clothing items were sold in different regions of the country. The analysis is to tell stories on the sales and revenue track for the clothing items. This also to make decisions based on facts on how clothing items are to be sold.

### Data Sources
Data was provided by the Incubator hub to be used for the project. The Primary data used here is sales data.xlsx
