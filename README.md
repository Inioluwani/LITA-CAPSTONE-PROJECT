# LITA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
This where I document my capstone project for my LITA Data Analysis class with the incubator hub. Here, I analysed the sales data provided.

### Project Title: Sales Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project was done on a sales data where a number of clothing items were sold in different regions of the country. The analysis is to tell stories on the sales and revenue track for the clothing items. This also to make decisions based on facts on how clothing items are to be sold.

### Data Sources
Data was provided by the Incubator hub to be used for the project. The Primary data used here is sales data.xlsx

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel : This was used for:
  1.  data cleaning
  2.  analysis 
  3.  creation of pivot tables
- Structured Query Language - This was used to query the data to provide data answers and trends.
  
- Power BI - This was used to create various data visualizations.
  
- GitHub- This was used to document the project.
  
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data was cleaned using microsoft excel. Duplicate rows were deleted by using the data ribbon. Data was filtered by column to detect blank spaces. The column names were formatted properly.

### Exploratoratory Data Analysis
EDA involved answering some questions about the sales data such as;
- what is the average sales per product?
- Whatis the total revenue by region?
- What is the total revenue by product?
- Who are the top 5 customers by purchases?
- What are the top performing products?

 ### Data Analysis
 This is where I include excel formulas, basic lines of queries from SQL and some 
 DAX expressions from PowerBi used during my analysis;
